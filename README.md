## **Hello Hello everyone ! ðŸ‘‹**

I'm an engineering student with a passion for video games, sports and creativity. I develop solutions to solve concrete problems for myself or my loved ones, but mostly for my own curiosity. I'm multi-creative: today I'm making a ring, tomorrow an armor and later a sword. I mean litteraly. My dream would be to have a workshop where I could design everything I imagine.
